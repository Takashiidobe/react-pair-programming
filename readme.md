#Please start the app by going into the root folder and typing `npm run dev` or
`yarn run dev` #If you'd like to work on the sass, go to the client/ folder in
your terminal and run `npm run sass` or `yarn run sass` in order to activate the
watch command on the sass (so it will compile into the main.css file);
